In this workshop we'll try to create a datavisualization dashboard using React/Redux.

## Dataset

We'll use the [epistat dataset](https://epistat.wiv-isp.be/covid/) from sciensano, the belgian public health institute.

## Next steps Inspiration

Need inspiration on what to do next? Here are some ideas

- Create `<circle>` on the `<Graph />` component for each datapoint
- Add an onClick event on each `<circle>` to modify the application state
- Create a calendar component to manually select a date
